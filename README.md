## Project Description

> This project is a small Real Time Chat Application built using React as a Frontend to a server Backend found at this [Github repository](https://github.com/RNtaate/Norp-Chat-App-Server)

> It is a `Mobile Only View` application built to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of Web Sockets and the use of the `Socket.io` and `Socket.io Client` Libraries.

> It allows any user to freely enter a chat name, select a chat group and start chatting freely with other users in the same chat group. The user can also view other users online and privately chat with them. The user also gets notified if they receive a message from a group or user they are not currently chatting with.

> #### Future Additional Features:
> - Ability to create custom groups and add other users to it.
> - Ability to search for users or groups available.
> - An authentication system.
> - Validation and display of error messages.
